# Usage instructions
**Make sure node and npm is installed on your computer.**
1. Clone the repository into a folder.
2. Run `npm install` in the main folder (it will also run the package installation for the api folder).
3. Rename the nodemon.json.example to nodemon.json and fill in the correct values for each environment variable. (Changes to this file need a complete restart of the application)
4. Start the script with `npm run dev`. Nodemon will restart the script after each change to the codebase.
